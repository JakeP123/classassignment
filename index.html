      <p>Jake Phillips is a 30 year old entrepreneur with an extensive background in business and sales. 
        He recently sold his first company for an undisclosed amount of money and has shifted his focus into his 
        new virtual reality treadmill business. Though the VR industry as a whole is slow, the business looks promising
        and will likely turn into something great!
